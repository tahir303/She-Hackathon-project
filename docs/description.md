On weekends, family trips or trips with friends we visit many public places where we use public toilets which are very unsanitized and unclean. These unsanitized and unclean toilets lead to several diseases, such as Malaria, Hepatitis, Flu, Cholera, Streptococcus, Typhoid, etc. Hence we introduce the concept of “GREEN SANITIZATION SYSTEM”. It is introduce to use and maintain the toilets clean, hygenic and smart way.

# WHAT IS THE PROJECT ABOUT?

The project is made up many sensors and database. Using these materials we are trying to provide the clean toilets and create awareness among the people.

# SCOPE OF PROJECT
This paper can ensure the responsibilities of the sweeper. By this concept we can add one more step towards “clean and disease free India”.

# EXECUTION METHOD

- SENSOR’S to detect dirt present in toilet.
- After the use of toilet, the sensor senses the basin of the toilet.
- If the dirt present, then the alarm rings or notification pops to clean the toilet to respective department or respective person. Through this activity awareness is spread.
- The range of sewage/septic tank is fixed so, when the sewage/septic tank is full the notification pops to respective department. This message can be send by the use of GSM
(Global System for Communication). The collected sewage from septic tank can be used as fertilizers in farms and in biogas plant. This fertilizer can be nutrious for soil and crops cultivated in that farm.
- In this system, SENSOR’s are also used to create AUTO HANDWASH, AUTO HAND-DRIER, etc.
- We can save water in tremendous amount by using the technology of AUTO FLUSH system which will be made with help of SENSOR’s.
- With the help of SENSOR’s we can also get notification when the water tank is full or empty.
- By creating app we can get notifications and locations of smart toilets. Also we can access the number of member are using it. This app may help us getting feedback is it working properly or not.

# ADVANTAGES

- It can create awareness among the people about the proper toilet management.
- It can prevent many contagious diseases like malaria, typhoid, cholera, streptococcus, asthma, etc.
- This promotes the “swachchabharat” scheme.
- This smart toilet can be very helpful for old people and small children.

# CONCLUSION
Our proposed project will create awareness among the people about the proper sanitation. It makes use of Internet of things, which is a rapidly growing technology. Our proposedsystem will make everyone to strictly follow the cleanliness and proper sanitation in the toilets. It prevents the many new contagious diseases that spreads due to improper sanitation of the toilets. Thus by using technologies in the smarter way, we can maintain the cleanliness which is next to the godliness. Keep Clean, Be Safe.
