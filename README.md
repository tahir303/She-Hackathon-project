## Short description

In our country, our government introduce the scheme called “Swatch Bharat” keeping toilet uncontainmented is one of the objective of clean India . In an existing system,
they are focused only on identifying the dart in toilets, observing the sweeper’s working . It can dodge many syndrome.

### What's the problem?

In our country specially in village area people do not have enough knowledge of using toilets. This leads to several diseases such as malaria, hepatitis, streptococcus, flu etc. to overcome all this problem we are implementing this project.

### How can technology help?

In that project we are using the IoT based microcontrollers which is used for programmable input output, solar plates which is for power supply, LCD display for light emission, buzzer, IR sensors, Sonic sensors which are help in project for detecting the water level and many things.

### The idea

Considering the cleanliness in india our team 'innovation greek' Implement the " Green sanitition system" . In which thr sensor are imbedded for automatic action. By using app we are controlling the services of all toilet. And also from the waste we are converting it into biogas and manure. All the idea is based of IBM cloud services
